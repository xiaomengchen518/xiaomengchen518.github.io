# Xiaomeng Chen’s Homepage

Welcome! I am an **incoming Assistant Professor** in the **School of Science and Engineering**
at **The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen**. I obtained my B.S. degree in Electronic
Information Science and Technology from **Nanjing University** in 2019, and received my Ph.D.
degree in Electronic and Computer Engineering from **The Hong Kong University of Science and
Technology (HKUST)** in 2023. From September 2023 to December 2025, I worked as a
**Postdoctoral Fellow** in the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering at **HKUST**.

## Research Interests

Distributed optimization, game theory, multi-agent systems, privacy-preserving and attack-resilient algorithms, and communication-efficient distributed systems.

See [here]({{ '/publications.html' | relative_url }}) for our publications.

## Openings

We are always looking for highly motivated students, postdoctoral researchers, and research assistants
with a strong mathematical background and research interests in distributed optimization and learning, differential privacy,   game theory and multi-agent networks. Opportunities for academic exchange and collaboration
in Hong Kong, Europe, and Australia may be available for suitable candidates.


Interested candidates are welcome to contact me via email with a brief CV.
